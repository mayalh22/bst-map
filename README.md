# boston adventure

ok hello!

this is a boston themed adventure game where you wake up in fenway and make different choices for different outcomes

i used wasm and rust (both for the first time if that is not obvious) and a whole buttload of help from youtube videos and gemini

- i also used javascript and html to load the wasm module and display to ui

i wanted to learn a new language because i so have been stuck in the html/css/js hole. it has been quite a challenge. i'm 99% sure it works but the ux is not as developed.

i may try and work on more story branches, images, and user interface stuff in the future

for now, enjoy!
